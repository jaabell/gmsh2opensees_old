Roadmap to version 1.0

These things need to be implemented for v.10

-Pattern (loads) object class
-Pattern GUI tab
-Timeseries object class
-Timeseries GUI tab
-Recorder object class
-Recorders GUI tab
-Variables GUI tab
-Run in opensees menu option
-Get results menu option
-Results visualisation (in GUI with matplotlib)
-Results to GMSH in binary mode.
-Configuration file (opensees and gmsh paths, recent project, etc, etc.)
-Recent projects menu option
-Preferences menu option

My goal is to implement these at at least 'one per week' rate so that the program is at version 1.0 by the end of the year. Then I'm going to create a series of usage video to show the whole process (gmsh file into an opensees file and back into plotting).
